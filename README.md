# GovRedemption

Built a simple CLI system in Go. I have been wanting to build something in Go for a while now, and I thought that this was a simple project to start with. Took <2 hours to complete.

## Run Code 
To start the program, use the following command:

Start: go run main.go <mapping_csv_file>  
Example Start: go run main.go staff-id-to-team-mapping.csv
